#### What additional architectural change can be made to reduce the internet facing attack surface of the web application instance.

S3 buckets could be hardened by only allowing access to them via VPC endpoints, therefore limiting the access to the data to EC2 instances deployed into the VPC only.

Web server can be moved to a private subnet (only exposing the load balancer to the internet).

#### Assuming the IAM permissions for the S3 bucket are still insecure, would creating VPC private endpoints for S3 prevent the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket.

If the attacker manages to take over the web server or by e.g. using a vulnerability of the web application stack, they could still impersonate the overly permissive IAM role.

#### Will applying default encryption setting to the s3 buckets encrypt the data that already exists?

No, only data that is newly uploaded would be encrypted. In order to encrypt old data, it would need to be re-uploaded in an encrypted fashion using e.g. AWS Batch.

#### What would happen if the original cloud formation templates are applied to this environment.

The changes made manually would be re-set, e.g. the encryption set manually would be deactivated and the IAM role would be reset to its original overly permissive form.
